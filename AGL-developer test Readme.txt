Submission notes

- All Angular 2 code is written in typescript and has been linted according to the tslint.json file.
- Unit tests for all components/services and pipes are included and run using Jasmine/Karma.
- E2E tests for the application are also included and run using Protractor.
- The resultant webpage has been built using a basically styled responsive design using bootstrap 4 to enable the stacking 
  of the male owned cats on top of the female owned cats as the page is reduced in width.
- While the test required cats only to be listed alphabetically, I have included the ability to alter the 
  sort order with the selection of a radio button. This allowed me to demonstrate the use of a pipe with in 
  the application. It also allowed me to include units tests for the pipe as well as demonstrate page interaction 
  from within the E2E testing.
